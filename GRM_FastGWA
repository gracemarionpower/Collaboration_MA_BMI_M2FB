#Estimate the genetic relationship matrix (GRM) between pairs of individuals from a set of SNPs

#The chrs.txt file lists the separate QC'd PLINK files for each chromosome
#The total_phenokeep.txt lists the two ID columns (family and individual) of partipants with phenotype data - this is for the purposes of reducing the computational time when constructing the GRM

#you must have the following GCTA version installed

#The chrs_plink.txt lists PLINK files for each chromosome
#the total_pheno.txt file lists the phenotype data in the third column (the family and individual data in the first two columns)
#the total_pheno.txt file lists the continuious covariate data (age and 20 PCs) in the third+ columns (the family and individual data in the first two columns)
